# projectone
As I journey through my 100 days of code.  I will stop along the way and make sure I understand by creating a project.  Track my journey as I evolve in hopes of showing others, they too have the ability to code.

Projectone-Is a basic html page with no css.  I wanted to practice the following;
Working on the Terminal by creating folders and files. 
Pushing and pulling files connecting the terminal and Github.
Writing basic html
Inserting an image
putting items in divs
creating a footer
adding social media buttons that work 
Using bootstrap glyphicons
researching and using a boilerplate header
